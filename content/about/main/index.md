  I am currently enrolled in the PhD programme called "Organic pollutants in the environment" at the Department of Analytic Chemistry at University of Barcelona. The title of my dissertation will be something similar to: **"Identification and analysis of sources of contamination in the environment using analytical methods"**, where I'll apply the [R software](http://www.a.com) and [Python](http://www.python.org) as programming languagues together with [QuantumGIS](http://qgis.org) for geostatistical modeling.
