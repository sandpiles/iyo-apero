  Abstract                 = {Background: Accurate pesticide use data are essential when studying the environmental and public health impacts of pesticide use. Since the mid-1990s, significant changes have occurred in when and how glyphosate herbicides are applied, and there has been a dramatic increase in the total volume applied. Methods: Data on glyphosate applications were collected from multiple sources and integrated into a dataset spanning agricultural, non-agricultural, and total glyphosate use from 1974-2014 in the United States, and from 1994-2014 globally. Results: Since 1974 in the U.S., over 1.6 billion kilograms of glyphosate active ingredient have been applied, or 19% of estimated global use of glyphosate (8.6 billion kilograms). Globally, glyphosate use has risen almost 15-fold since so-called “Roundup Ready,” genetically engineered glyphosate-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. Two-thirds of the total volume of glyphosate applied in the U.S. from 1974 to 2014 has been sprayed in just the last 10 years. The corresponding share globally is 72%. In 2014, farmers sprayed enough glyphosate to apply ~1.0 kg/ha (0.8 pound/acre) on every hectare of U.S.-cultivated cropland and nearly 0.53 kg/ha (0.47 pounds/acre) on all cropland worldwide. Conclusions: Genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant crops now account for about 56% of global glyphosate use. In the U.S., no pesticide has come remotely close to such intensive and widespread use. This is likely the case globally, but published global pesticide use data are sparse. Glyphosate will likely remain the most widely applied pesticide worldwide for years to come, and interest will grow in quantifying ecological and human health impacts. Accurate, accessible time-series data on glyphosate use will accelerate research progress.},

The biosensor is based on the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme using screen-printed electrodes and an own designed potentiostat. Quality parameters have been tested using chlorpyrifos-oxon as reference compound. The lower concentration detected was of 2microg/L for an enzymatic charge of 10mU, the linearity was near to one order of magnitude and the repeatability was of 4.7% (n=5) at 4microg/L. Spiked and non-spiked water samples, beverages and vegetable extracts were used to validate the system and for pepper extracts, the response was compared to HPLC-MS. In these samples, the biosensor was able to detect pesticide concentrations in the order of the tenth of g/L, although an important matrix effect was observed which was eliminated by calibrating the system with the same matrix as the sample to be tested. Measured concentrations were comparable to those obtained using commercial laboratory potentiostats and thus the suitability of the biosensor prototype for field application was proved.},

The system consists of (i) a screen-printed electrode with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) immobilized on it, (ii) a self-developed portable potentiostat with an analog to digital (A/D) converter and a serial interface for transferring data to a portable PC and (iii) an own designed software, developed with Lab-Windows CVI, used to record and process the measurements. The system has been developed to perform high precision amperometrical measurements with low drifts, low noise and a good reproducibility. In the configuration depicted, the percentage of AChE inhibition is proportional to the content of neurotoxic agents in a sample. This type of measurement is performed by the steady-state method from the first steady current (by a phosphate buffer solution) and the second steady current (by an enzymatic reaction produced by the addition of acetylthiocholine chloride to the solution). Validation was performed by analyzing spiked water samples containing pesticides. The design is specially suited for screening purposes, does not need sample preconcentration, is totally autonomous and suitable for the field detection of neurotoxic agents in water.},

  Abstract                 = {The critical period for weed control (CPWC) is a period in the crop growth cycle during which weeds must be controlled to prevent yield losses. Knowing the CPWC is useful in making decisions on the need for and timing of weed control and in achieving efficient herbicide use from both biological and economic perspectives. An increase in the use of herbicide-tolerant crops, especially soybean resistant to glyphosate, has stimulated interest in the concept of CPWC. Recently, several studies examined this concept in glyphosate-resistant corn and soybean across the midwestern United States. However, these studies presented various methods for data analysis and reported CPWC on the basis of a variety of crop- or weed-related parameters. The objectives of this study are (1) to provide a review of the concept and studies of the CPWC, (2) to suggest a common method to standardize the process of data
analysis, and (3) to invite additional discussions for further debate on the subject. Wide adoption of the suggested method of data analysis will allow easier comparison of the results among sites and between researchers.},

Many previous analyses have used flawed metrics to evaluate herbicide intensity and toxicity trends. Here, I show that herbicide use intensity increased over the last 25 years in maize, cotton, rice and wheat. Although GE crops have been previously implicated in increasing herbicide use, herbicide increases were more rapid in
non-GE crops. Even as herbicide use increased, chronic toxicity associated with herbicide use decreased in two out of six crops, while acute toxicity decreased in four out of six crops. In the final year for which data were available (2014 or 2015), glyphosate accounted for 26% of maize, 43% of soybean and 45% of cotton herbicide applications. However, due to relatively low chronic toxicity, glyphosate contributed only 0.1, 0.3 and 3.5% of the chronic toxicity hazard in those crops, respectively.},

In order to gain knowledge about their presence in the aquatic environment in an off-season situation with regard to pesticide and biocide applications, these substances were analysed in freshwater, seawater and fish samples from Denmark. Aclonifen, bifenox, cypermethrin and heptachlor were below the limits of detection (LODs) in all samples. However, the LODs for cypermethrin and heptachlor exceeded the annual average environmental quality standards (AA-EQSs). Cybutryn, terbutryn, heptachlor epoxide and HBCD were detected in the majority of samples, with detection frequencies of 100% for heptachlor epoxide and HBCD in water and 90% in fish. No concentration was above maximum allowable concentration (MAC)-EQS values, but AA-EQS values were exceeded for all four compounds by several samples, including 100% of the water samples with regard to heptachlor epoxide. Methodological issues remain for cypermethrin, and to a certain extent for heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide, for which water LODs were above AA-EQSs although a water volume of 12 L was combined with very sensitive high resolution mass spectrometry.},

However, comprehensive understanding of the hazard and risk of these contaminants is currently lacking. Therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the toxic effects of four ubiquitous herbicides (atrazine, diuron, Irgarol(®)1051 and isoproturon) and herbicide mixtures on marine microalgae. Using a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry based bioassay we demonstrated a clear species and herbicide specific toxicity and showed that the current environmental legislation does not protect algae sufficiently against diuron and isoproturon. Although a low actual risk of herbicides in the field was demonstrated, monitoring data revealed that concentrations occasionally reach potential effect levels. Hence it cannot be excluded that herbicides contribute to observed changes in phytoplankton species composition in coastal waters, but this is likely to occur only occasionally.},

  abstract = {This article describes the development and validation of a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of over 400 multi-class priority and emerging pollutants with different physicochemical properties in environmental waters (surface water and wastewater). The proposed approach is based on the use of a database consisting of retention time/exact mass (of selected ions) pairs implemented with specific software for data analysis. The targeted list comprises 430 contaminants belonging to different compound categories, including 105 multiclass pharmaceuticals (analgesics/anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, lipid regulators, beta-blockers, antiepileptic/psychiatrics ulcer healings, diuretics, hormones and bronchodilatadors), life-style products (caffeine, nicotine), 21 drugs of abuse and their metabolites, 279 pesticides and some of their more relevant metabolites, nitrosamines, flame retardants, plasticizers and perfluorinated compounds. The proposed approach included a simple offline solid phase extraction (SPE) step using polymeric cartridges (Oasis HLB) with 200 mL of water sample loaded, followed by analysis by rapid resolution liquid chromatography electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) in both positive and negative modes. The identification of the positive findings is accomplished with the data from accurate masses of the target ions along with retention time data and characteristic in-source fragment ions. The overall method performance was satisfactory with limits of quantification lower than 10 ng L−1 for the 44% of studied compounds. Recoveries between 50% and 130% were obtained for the 65% of the analytes (281 compounds). Matrix effects occurring with wastewater matrices were also assessed. The developed method was applied to the determination of target analytes in real surface water and wastewater samples.},

The major remaining issues are: (1) when guidelines are not already applied, what incentives would encourage European farmers to adopt those guidelines?

  number   = {3},
  volume   = {28},
  abstract = {Background: Accurate pesticide use data are essential when studying the environmental and public health impacts of pesticide use. Since the mid-1990s, significant changes have occurred in when and how glyphosate herbicides are applied, and there has been a dramatic increase in the total volume applied. Methods: Data on glyphosate applications were collected from multiple sources and integrated into a dataset spanning agricultural, non-agricultural, and total glyphosate use from 1974 to 2014 in the United States, and from 1994 to 2014 globally. Results: Since 1974 in the U.S., over 1.6 billion kilograms of glyphosate active ingredient have been applied, or 19% of estimated global use of glyphosate (8.6 billion kilograms). Globally, glyphosate use has risen almost 15-fold since so-called "Roundup Ready" genetically engineered glyphosate-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. Two-thirds of the total volume of glyphosate applied in the U.S. from 1974 to 2014 has been sprayed in just the last 10 years. The corresponding share globally is 72%. In 2014, farmers sprayed enough glyphosate to apply around 1.0 kg/ha (0.8 pound/acre) on every hectare of US-cultivated cropland and nearly 0.53 kg/ha (0.47 pounds/acre) on all cropland worldwide. Conclusions: Genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant crops now account for about 56% of global glyphosate use. In the US, no pesticide has come remotely close to such intensive and widespread use. This is likely the case globally, but published global pesticide use data are sparse. Glyphosate will likely remain the most widely applied pesticide worldwide for years to come, and interest will grow in quantifying ecological and human health impacts. Accurate, accessible time-series data on glyphosate use will accelerate research progress.},

  abstract = {Policy measures are needed to reduce the risks associated with pesticides application in agriculture, resulting in more sustainable agricultural systems. Pesticide taxes can be an important tool in the toolkit of policy-makers and are of increasing importance in European agriculture. However, little is known about the effects of such tax solutions and their impacts on the environment, farmers, and human health. We aim to fill this gap and synthesize experiences made in the European countries that have introduced pesticide taxes, i.e., France, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The major findings of our analysis are: (1) overall, the effectiveness of pesticide taxes is limited, but if a tax on a specific pesticide is high enough, the application and the associated risks will be reduced significantly; (2) in all countries, hoarding activities have been observed before a tax introduction or increase. Therefore, short-term effects of taxes are substantially smaller than long-term effects; (3) differentiated taxes are superior to undifferentiated taxes because fewer accompanying measures are required to reach policy goals; (4) tax scheme designs are not always in line with the National Action Plan targets. Low tax levels do not necessarily lead to a reduction of pesticide input and differentiated taxes do not necessarily lead to fewer violations of water residue limits.},

  abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y, y, are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters 0. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Defying comprehension is the complexity of the chemical sea that surrounds, sustains, and constitutes all life. From this sea, never-ending challenges are faced by organisms striving to defend against those multitudes of chemicals that cause cellular stress or harm. Biological mechanisms have evolved for maintaining organism homeostasis during contact with these harmful substances. Most of these chemical stressors have long existed or are produced by myriads of human activities. However,
for those chemicals that are relatively new to the world, the mechanisms for homeostasis maintenance are not necessarily adequate. Chemicals for which organisms have had the least time to adapt are those that only recently have emerged as environmental contaminants.},
